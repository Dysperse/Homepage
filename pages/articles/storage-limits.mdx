<Layout title="Storage limits">

We hope you are enjoying using Carbon. However, we have to limit the amount of storage you can use to prevent abuse, and so we can keep the service free for everyone.

We utilize a credit-based system to limit storage and simplify storage limits for users, and us as well.

- Each property has a storage limit of **500** credits

Any item, room, task, board, or memo you create on Carbon will cost 1 credit, multiplied by the type of storage you are using.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Storage type</th>
      <th>Credits per item</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Item</td>
      <td>x2.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Room</td>
      <td>x1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Memo</td>
      <td>x5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Board</td>
      <td>x10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### For example...

- If you create 50 items, you will use 125 credits
- If you create 50 memos, you will use 250 credits
- If you create 10 boards, you will use 100 credit

We do hope you understand that we have to limit storage to prevent abuse, and so we can keep the service free for everyone.

We also drop in a few giveaways from time to time via our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/9EJSxkJhnQ), so keep an eye out for those!

If you have any further questions, please feel free to [contact us](/contact).
