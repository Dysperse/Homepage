Carbon encrypts your data using AES-256 encryption. This means that your data is encrypted using a 256-bit key, which is one of the strongest encryption algorithms available.

## What is encryption?

Encryption is a process of converting plain text into encoded text that can only be read or accessed with the proper decryption key. It is commonly used to secure communication and protect sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized parties. Encryption uses a set of algorithms, known as ciphers, to encode the data. The sender uses a specific cipher to encrypt the data, and the recipient uses a corresponding cipher to decrypt the data. This process helps to ensure that the information is secure as it is transmitted from one party to another, and that it remains private and confidential.

Take a look at the example below:

## Why is encryption important?

Encryption is important because it helps to protect information from being accessed by unauthorized parties. When data is encrypted, it is converted into a coded format that can only be read or accessed with the correct decryption key. This is useful for a number of reasons:

- Confidentiality: Encryption helps to ensure that sensitive information is kept private and confidential. Without encryption, it is possible for unauthorized parties to access and read sensitive data, such as financial transactions or personal information.

- Security: Encryption helps to secure communication and protect against cyber attacks. If data is transmitted over the internet or through a network, it is vulnerable to being intercepted and accessed by hackers. Encryption helps to prevent this by encoding the data, making it much more difficult for unauthorized parties to access it.

- Compliance: In some industries, encryption is required by law in order to protect sensitive information and meet regulatory requirements. For example, the healthcare industry is required to encrypt patient data in order to protect it from unauthorized access.

Overall, encryption is an important tool for protecting sensitive information and ensuring the security and confidentiality of communication.

## What is AES-256 bit encryption?

AES 256-bit encryption is a type of encryption standard that uses a symmetric-key algorithm to protect data. It is one of the most secure encryption methods used in the world today, and it is commonly used to secure sensitive information, such as financial transactions and government communications. AES 256-bit encryption uses a key that is 256 bits long, which makes it virtually impossible to crack. The key is used to encrypt the data, and the same key is used to decrypt the data. This means that only someone with the correct key can access the encrypted information
