<Layout title="Goals">

Goals are a way to keep track of your progress. You can set goals for yourself and track your progress towards them.
For example, you can set a goal to...

- Study for an exam every day, for 2 hours
- Go caffeine-free for 5 days
- Meditate every day for 20 minutes
- ...and so much more!

## How to set a goal

You can set a goal by clicking on the "Goals" tab in the sidebar. Then, scroll down and click on the "Set a goal" button.

You can either choose a goal from the gallery, or create your own.

## How to track your progress

Carbon will notify you to work towards the goal every day. You can also track your progress by clicking on the "Goals" tab in the sidebar.

## How to work on a goal

Click on the "Daily routine" button in the goals page. Once you've completed the goal, click on the checkbox, and Carbon will mark it as complete.
