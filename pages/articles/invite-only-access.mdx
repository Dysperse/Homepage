## What is invite-only access?

Invite-only access refers to a system or service that is only available to users who have received an invitation from the owner or administrator. This type of access is often used to control who has access to a particular system or service, and it can be useful for a number of reasons:

- Security: Invite-only access can help to increase security by limiting access to a select group of users. This can be useful for protecting sensitive information or for preventing unauthorized access to a system or service.

- Quality control: Invite-only access can be used to ensure that only high-quality users have access to a system or service. This can be useful for maintaining the quality and integrity of a service.

- Privacy: Invite-only access can be used to create a private community or network, where only invited members can participate. This can be useful for maintaining privacy and limiting access to sensitive information.

Overall, invite-only access can be an effective way to control access to a system or service, and it can be useful for a variety of purposes, including security, quality control, and privacy.

By default, your group is private, and anything you share with your group is only visible to members of your group. Carbon does not allow you to share with the public, and you cannot share with anyone outside of your group.

If you would like to share with someone outside of your group, you can invite them to join your group. This will allow them to view any content that you share with your group.
