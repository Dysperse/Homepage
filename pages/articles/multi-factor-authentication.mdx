# What is multi factor authentication?
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity. This means that in addition to a password, a second factor of authentication is required in order to access a system or service. The purpose of MFA is to make it more difficult for unauthorized users to access a system or account, as it requires multiple methods of authentication rather than just a single password. Some common types of second factors that may be used in MFA include a security token, a biometric factor such as a fingerprint or facial recognition, or a code sent via SMS or email. MFA helps to increase the security of systems and accounts by adding an extra layer of protection.

# How do I enable multi factor authentication?

To enable multi factor authentication, you will need to:

- Log into your Carbon account and navigate to the "Privacy" page.
- From there, you can click on the "Privacy & Security" tab and enable multi factor authentication.
- Download an authenticator app on your phone, such as Google Authenticator or Authy.
- Scan the QR code that appears on the screen and enter the code that is generated by the app.
- Enter the code that is generated by the app into the "Enter code" field and click "Verify".

Congratulations! You have successfully enabled multi factor authentication on your Carbon account. You will now be required to enter the code that is generated by the authenticator app in addition to your password in order to log into your account.
