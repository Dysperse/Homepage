By default, Smartlist provides a preset shopping list and to-do list. However, if you want to create more lists, such as "School supplies", or "Amazon returns", here's how to do so:

- Navigate to your [dashboard](https://my.smartlist.tech)
- Scroll down and click the "Create List" button
- Enter a title for the list and hit enter
- You should now see the list you just created in your dashboard
