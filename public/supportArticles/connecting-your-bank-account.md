Smartlist provides a simple way to connect your bank account to your Smartlist account to automatically log payments, and help you start saving money. Smartlist uses [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) to connect your bank account to your Smartlist account.

**The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has certified Plaid online banking for its high-security standards.**

Plaid works as an intermediate between banks and financial institutions or apps that need access to bank information. It offers a standardized API that allows banks to integrate their platforms without the need to build custom apps. Plaid uses end-to-end encryption to share personal and banking information in a secure way.


In a bank verification, these institutions will be able to see only information related to:
* Account balances and retrieve up to 24 months of transactions. Plaid bank linking is easy and secure.
* You can receive a better customer experience since financial services are simple.


### How do I get started?

After logging in to your Smartlist account, navigate to your finance dashboard. Click "Continue", and then "Connect your bank account".

Then, select the financial institution in which you hold your primary bank account. If you cannot see it on the list, type your Bank Name in the “Search” field, and your bank should appear.

The platform will redirect to your financial institution’s website. Enter your online bank credentials, account number, and routing number to continue the Plaid bank verification. **Please ensure you are using a personal computer/mobile.**

If the process asks you to input a token, your financial institution must send it and send it to you in text messages directly to the phone number you have provided at your bank. This will usually occur if you have multi-factor authentication set up with your financial institution. Click the blue “Submit” button.

> Smartlist does not have access to your personal data, credit card numbers, or social security number.

Once you link your account, you will receive the below confirmation. Next, you must click the “Continue” button. Do not click the “x” in the top right and/or close the window.
